# ChainCo
  - ChainCo is a perimissionless, composable and confidential protocol which helps in owning, digitization and storing of supreme documents with high confidentiality and cross-chain support 

## Aim

Credentials are issued ERC5192 tokens which also helps users upskill in the right direction. All sensitive information is wrapped around confidentiality provided by THFE library on the INCO network. We support native cross-chain swaps for BTC, ETH, DOT, ARB and users can swap any tokens in one chain to the other chain. Chainflip uses Just-in-time AMM with low slippage swaps

## Bone of contention and current Solution

  - Unlike traditional certification methods vulnerable to forgery, 
ChainCo operates on the secure blockchain, functioning like an on-chain LinkedIn. 
  - ChainCo introduces three core features: first, Soul Bound Tokens (SBT) are tamper-proof and issued by whitelisted organizations. 
  - Utilizing multi-batch processing, we streamline transactions, reducing gas fees. 
  - ChainCo tokens are EIP 5192 compatible, ensuring they can't be transferred after minting. 
  - The second feature introduces a peer-driven endorsement system, allowing users to endorse others based on their ChainCo holdings. 
  - The third feature is a dynamic reputation score, providing a reliable proof of individual proficiency. This not only streamlines hiring but also encourages continuous professional growth in the job market.
  - Our platform safeguards verified skills and fosters a competitive environment for ongoing skill development.

## How it works
  - Organization can send ERC5192 compatible tokens to peers wallet address
  - whitelisted Organization's can perform single mint by adding metadata or Bulk minting which supports multi batch transaction by just importing a .csv file.
  - Users who hold the ChainCo, also access the reputation score so as to attain visibility and helps give an edge in the job market.
  - Hiring managers can view the portfolio of individual users by entering the wallet address or just look at the reputation score of every account that has ChainCo in their account and gain a deeper insight on that particular user
